## Project Structure:

### `views.py`
The backend logic is put in the `views.py` file, which defines a Django class-based view named `home`. This view handles both GET and POST requests,
managing the rendering of the initial HTML page and processing form submissions.

### `home.html`
The main HTML template, `home.html`, provides the structure for the user interface. It includes a form for inputting YouTube URLs, dynamic content display
for fetched video details, and resolution selection buttons.

### `styles.css`
Styling is managed in the `styles.css` file, enhancing the visual appeal of the web interface. The CSS includes styles for form elements, buttons, and image
hover effects, contributing to an engaging user experience.
